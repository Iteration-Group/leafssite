Leaf's Website
&nbsp
Heya people! This is my website! Basically, a blog page plus a few other things.
&nbsp
The website will be hosted at leaf.neocities.org (NOT leaf.github.io), however nothing is set in stone.
&nbsp
The site is made primarily in HTML, CSS and JS. However, in the future I may plan to add some CoffeeScript, PHP and TS.
&nbsp
If you guys want to commit to this site, feel free to shoot me a Pull Request!
&nbsp
The Discord server with the information about this site and other things I do is here: https://discord.gg/suudF9aEd6

If you want to contact me professionally, email me at corenetworkcontact@protonmail.com!

Thanks, Leaf!
