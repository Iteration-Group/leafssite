Leaf's Website
Heya people! This is my website! Basically, a blog page plus a few other things.
The website will be hosted at leaf.neocities.org (NOT leaf.github.io), however nothing is set in stone.
The site is made primarily in HTML, CSS and JS. However, in the future I may plan to add some CoffeeScript, PHP and TS.
If you guys want to commit to this site, feel free to shoot me a Pull Request!
The Discord server with the information about this site and other things I do is here: https://discord.gg/suudF9aEd6
If you want to contact me professionally, email me at corenetworkcontact@protonmail.com!
Thanks, Leaf!
