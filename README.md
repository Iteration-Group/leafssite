Leaf's Website

</space>
Heya people! This is my website! Basically, a blog page plus a few other things.

The website will be hosted at leaf.neocities.org (NOT leaf.github.io), however nothing is set in stone.

The site is made primarily in HTML, CSS and JS. However, in the future I may plan to add some CoffeeScript, PHP and TS.
